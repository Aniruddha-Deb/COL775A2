## Introduction

This is the official PyTorch implementation for paper: [SlotFormer: Unsupervised Visual Dynamics Simulation with Object-Centric Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05861), which is accepted by ICLR 2023.
The code contains:

-   Training base object-centric slot models
-   Video prediction task on OBJ3D and CLEVRER
-   VQA task on CLEVRER
-   VQA task on Physion
-   Planning task on PHYRE

## Update

-   2023.1.20: The paper is accepted by ICLR 2023!
-   2022.10.26: Support Physion VQA task and PHYRE planning task
-   2022.10.16: Initial code release!
    -   Support base object-centric model training
    -   Support SlotFormer training
    -   Support evaluation on the video prediction task
    -   Support evaluation on the CLEVRER VQA task

## Installation

Please refer to [install.md](docs/install.md) for step-by-step guidance on how to install the packages.

## Experiments

**This codebase is tailored to [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) GPU clusters with preemption mechanism.**
For the configs, we mainly use RTX6000 with 24GB memory (though many experiments don't require so much memory).
Please modify the code accordingly if you are using other hardware settings:

-   Please go through `scripts/train.py` and change the fields marked by `TODO:`
-   Please read the config file for the model you want to train.
    We use DDP with multiple GPUs to accelerate training.
    You can use less GPUs to achieve a better memory-speed trade-off
